Three different AIs for Reversi (Othello)
 * Random - plays randomly
 * AlphaBeta - AlphaBeta
 * Adjust - AlphaBeta with adjustable depth
 
 Runing the program has two options
  1. `dart ./main.dart host playerNumber aiType(random,alphabeta,adjust) [depth]`
  2. `./main.exe host playerNumber aiType(random,alphabeta,adjust) [depth]`
